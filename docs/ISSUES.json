      "description": "State is managed through chrome.storage.sync with direct reads/writes scattered throughout the codebase. As the codebase grows, state synchronization becomes harder. Consider implementing a centralized state management pattern or at least centralizing storage operations in utility functions.",

        "Storage operations centralized in utility module",
        "Consistent error handling across all storage operations",
