      "title": "Add test coverage for the extension",
      "description": "The extension currently has no unit tests, integration tests, or E2E tests. This makes refactoring risky and bugs may go undetected. Need to implement comprehensive test coverage using Chrome extension testing frameworks.",

      "title": "Implement centralized state management",
      "description": "State is managed through chrome.storage.sync with direct reads/writes scattered throughout the codebase. As the codebase grows, state synchronization becomes harder. Consider implementing a centralized state management pattern or at least centralizing storage operations in utility functions.",

      "description": "If user has multiple Chrome devices with the extension signed in to sync, the water log counter could have conflicts (one device increments while another is offline). Need to decide on approach: device-specific counts, cloud aggregation, or document per-device behavior.",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Decision made on multi-device water logging strategy",
        "Either: implement device-specific counting with aggregation",
